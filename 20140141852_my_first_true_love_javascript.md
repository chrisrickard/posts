Javascript was the first language I truly loved, and I remember the day we first met like it was yesterday.

I was 14 years old, and along my compadre Netscape Navigator, would spend hours surfing the waves of the World Wide Web at my local library. Blue underlined links, Times New Roman, and grey backgrounds - this was the future, and I was in awe.

I was altavista-ing for images of my favourite bands and saving them to my floppy disk when I first met her, Javascript was weaving magic within the webpage I was browsing. 

She was portraying a simple digital clock. The hours, minutes, and seconds were moving in front of my eyes, and I had never seen anything like it. Now I had seen animated gifs (my own webpage on /SunsetStrip had both balls-of-fire, and a hand that to grabbed at you from the page) - but this was different. This clock seemed alive. It knew the *actual* time... it was smart.

Javascript pulled back the curtains and introduced me to a world I never knew. From learning how to embed (steal) that clock, putting it onto my own website, customising the colours, and learning how it ticked. Javascript held my hand whilst she gradually enticed me into understanding programming - and for a 14 year old boy that was only really interested in girls and smoking cigarettes - that was an achievement.

I soon fell in love with DHTML, then CSS, Web Standards, Backend languages - and virtually everything else related to coding. I went to university to study software development, fell deeper in love, and have never looked back.

I have developed software for large enterprise companies, for startups, and everything in-between. I now run my own [software company](http://inoutput.io), and still get a warm 'n fuzzy feeling every time I see her. 

I for one love that she is so famous these days. Her beauty is unyielding in so many amazing libraries, on the [backend](http://nodejs.org/), even inside [hardware](http://tessel.io/). She has such a great life still to come, and I thank her what she has brought to mine.
