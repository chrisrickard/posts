> Spinning in infinity. He says, "Amen and Hallelujah!"

Imagine a machine built of many cogs. Cogs of different sizes and speeds, spinning, twisting, and turning with minute precision. A masterpiece of engineering - every sub-component working in unison together, creating a machine far greater than the sum of its parts. 

For a software engineer this is a wondrous image.
Everyday we strive for this efficiency in our work, whilst achieving such modularity within an intricate system.

Efficient companies seem to function like a machine of many cogs (at least from the outside they appear to) - many different people of varying shapes and sizes, all spinning together to create amazingness.

But humans don't spin like cogs. We spin... well, differently.

Some spin fast in the early morning, and some spin their fastest in the dark of the night.

Some spin in short bursts, slowing down to then plan their next most efficient spin. Whilst some spin at a constant rate throughout whole day.



Unlike real cogs - we don't spin from the motion of the person next to us spinning. We all spin for different reasons and different motivations. Love, money, power, approval, curiosity, the challenge of the spin - the reason for the spin is complex to say the least.

An effective collection of spinning humans is magic.
