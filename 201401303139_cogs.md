> Spinning in infinity. He says, "Amen and Hallelujah!"

Imagine a machine built of many cogs. Cogs of different sizes and speeds, all spinning, twisting, and turning with minute precision. A masterpiece of engineering - every sub-component working in unison together, creating a machine far greater than just the sum of it's parts. 

As a software engineer this is a wondrous image.
Everyday we strive for this efficiency in our work, whilst achieving modularity within such an intricate system.

For a lot of people, this appears a great team, or company functions.
Many different people, varying shapes and sizes - all spinning together to create amazingness.

But humans don't spin like cogs. We spin... well, differently.
Some of us spin fast in the early mornings (before other cogs are spinning), and then slow down in the afternoon. Some spin in short bursts throughout the day, and some reside motionless, planning their next most efficient spin.

We don't spin due to the motion of the person next to us spinning. We all spin for different reasons, different motivations. Love, money, power, approval, curiosity, the challenge - the reasons for why a persons spins is complex to say the least.


* many people working in isolation.. chaos.

* strict rules for spinning

* or great overseers.. coordinating and communicatin
